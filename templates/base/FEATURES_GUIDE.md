## 2. Student workflow

Students can:

- flag questions;
- use calculator;
- use read-aloud;
- use shortcuts `A-D`, `N`, `P`, arrows, `R`, `S`;
- submit before time ends.

### After exam

- If results are released: score, grade, review, explanations, and submission code are shown.

```

```

## 5. Deployment tools

- `deployment_validator.html`: confirms required files and config strings.
- `link_checker.html`: checks if an exam code/link is valid and ready.
- `feature_guide.html`: browser-readable feature guide.
- `COMPLETE_SQL_SETUP.sql`: canonical database setup.

## 6. Important limitations

- Browser proctoring flags are supportive evidence, not perfect proof.
- Essay scoring is rule-based and should be manually reviewed for high-stakes exams.
- Static hosting cannot securely hide all frontend logic; security-critical checks must stay in Supabase SQL/RLS/RPC.
- Exam links/codes should be treated like private access tokens.


## CBT v3 note

Before deployment, run `COMPLETE_SQL_SETUP.sql`, then upload all static files. CBT v3 includes a rewritten `PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` for manual AI-assisted CSV question generation, a Teacher Dashboard reference for all 17 question types, and a downloadable CSV template with all 17 type examples. No runtime AI API is used.
