## 1. What this system does

HMG Academy CBT Pro is a browser-based computer-based testing platform for schools, tutorial centres, examination practice programmes, and training organisations. It provides three portals:

| Portal | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Public landing page | `index.html` | Explains the platform and directs users to each portal. |
| Teacher dashboard | `teacher.html` | Create exams, upload/import questions, manage students, monitor results, export analytics. |
| Student portal | `student.html` | Students enter an exam code/link, take the exam, auto-save progress, submit, and receive a result or held-result notice. |
| Admin panel | `admin.html` | Approve teachers, supervise platform data, run security/deployment checks, export platform data. |

The platform is intentionally **zero-build**: upload the files to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or any static hosting provider. Supabase supplies database and authentication using the free tier.

## 2. Major v3.1 enterprise upgrades

v3.1 focuses on correctness, security, and enterprise readiness while preserving all existing features.

### Database and SQL correctness

- `COMPLETE_SQL_SETUP.sql` has been rearranged so all helper functions exist **before** RLS policies reference them.
- Admin RPC functions now enforce admin status inside PostgreSQL through `public.is_platform_admin()`.
- Anonymous students no longer need broad table reads for exams, results, or rosters.
- Public student actions now use safe RPCs:
  - `get_public_exam_by_code(p_code)`
  - `verify_student_for_exam(p_exam_id, p_student_id)`
  - `get_exam_attempt_count(p_exam_id, p_student_name, p_student_class, p_student_id_ref)`
- Results now store decimal scores using `NUMERIC(10,2)` for partial-credit question types.
- Student submissions are accepted only when the exam is open, active, not archived, and not expired.

### Platform features added/enhanced

- Secure public exam loading RPC.
- Secure registered-student ID verification RPC.
- Secure attempt-count RPC.
- Decimal partial-credit scoring.
- Negative marking enforcement.
- Teacher-controlled result release/hold mode.
- Certificate/submission verification code saved with each result.
- JAMB-style keyboard shortcuts: `A-D`, `N`, `P`, arrow keys, `R`, `S`.
- CSV question metadata: `Difficulty`, `Tags`, and `Section` columns.
- Safer mixed old/new question storage parsing.
- Updated deployment validator and link checker.
- Updated documentation and security guidance.

## 3. Question types supported

| Type | Code | Auto-scored? | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Multiple Choice | `mcq` | Yes | A-D option selection. |
| Multiple Response | `mrq` | Yes | Partial credit or all-or-nothing. |
| True/False | `tf` | Yes | A=True, B=False. |
| Short Answer | `short` | Yes | Exact/accepted-answer list. |
| Numeric | `numeric` | Yes | Supports tolerance and units. |
| Matching | `matching` | Yes | Partial credit by matched pairs. |
| Ordering | `ordering` | Yes | Partial credit by correct position. |
| Cloze / multi-blank | `cloze` | Yes | Pipe-separated accepted answers per blank. |
| Essay | `essay` | Rule-based | Keyword/minimum-word score; teacher review recommended. |
| Categorization | `categorization` | Yes | Partial credit per item category. |
| Multi-numeric | `multi_numeric` | Yes | Several numeric answers in one question. |

### CSV columns

```text
Question,A,B,C,D,CorrectAnswer,Explanation,Type,Tolerance,Unit,Accept,MRQ_AON,Pairs,Items,Difficulty,Tags,Section
```

The first 7 columns remain backward-compatible. Columns 8–17 are optional and enable advanced question types, scoring controls, analytics, and item-bank metadata.

## 6. Deployment quick start

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Copy the Project URL and anon public key.
3. Replace `SB_URL` and `SB_KEY` in:
   - `teacher.html`
   - `student.html`
   - `admin.html`
   - `link_checker.html`
4. Set `ADMIN_EMAIL` in `teacher.html` and `admin.html`.
5. Run **all** of `COMPLETE_SQL_SETUP.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor.
6. Upload the repository files to GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel/Cloudflare Pages.
7. Visit `deployment_validator.html`.
8. Test: teacher signup → admin approval → create exam → student submit → teacher/admin verify result.

For detailed steps, read `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## 7. Cost model

| Layer | Tool | Cost |
|---|---|---:|
| Hosting | GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages | Free tier |

## 8. Security principles

- Never place a Supabase `service_role` key in any frontend file.
- Use only the anon key in HTML.
- Run the v3.1 SQL so RLS and RPC guards are active.
- Treat exam access codes as private bearer tokens.
- Rotate exam codes if shared accidentally.
- Use HTTPS in production.
- Export backups regularly.
- Review `SECURITY.md` before production use.

## 9. Brand statement

HMG Academy CBT Pro is part of the HMG Technologies mission under HMG Concepts: **Learning Deliberately. Teaching Authentically.** It is built for Nigerian and African education realities — low budgets, mixed devices, variable internet, and the need for dependable assessment workflows without expensive subscriptions or paid AI APIs.

## 10. Complete file inventory

A complete file-by-file inventory is available in `FILE_INVENTORY.md`.


## 2026 Enterprise repair package

This repository now includes granular anti-cheat selection, optional proctoring, robust RPC-based result saving, verifiable certificates, expanded working Math/Science keyboard, and updated SQL. Run `COMPLETE_SQL_SETUP.sql` in Supabase before deploying the updated static files to Vercel or Cloudflare Pages.
## CBT v2 package

CBT v2 adds more question types, always-on Math/Science keyboard availability during exams, and admin-supervised teacher dashboard control mode. See `ADVANCED_QUESTION_TYPES_GUIDE.md` and `CBT_V2_AUDIT_AND_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md`.
## CBT v3 authoring package

CBT v3 updates the teacher question-type reference, CSV template download, and `PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`. The prompt template is now a practical question-bank generation prompt file for teachers who want an AI assistant to produce manual CSV question banks. It supports both the 11 core types and the full 17-type enterprise set.
## SEO, PWA and lead generation

The platform includes `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `llms.txt`, improved PWA manifest metadata, service worker caching, Open Graph/Twitter metadata, JSON-LD structured data, and landing-page lead links to the HMG Concepts ecosystem. See `SEO_PWA_LEAD_GENERATION.md`.
## Repair release note

This package fixes a critical `teacher.html` layout nesting bug that prevented Assessments, Results, Analytics, Settings and Students pages from appearing after sidebar clicks. See `CBT_REPAIR_AUDIT_REPORT.md`.
## CBT v4 package

CBT v4 adds PWA install enforcement, student hide/show question navigator, teacher-side result/certificate printing, Q&A packet download, and exam-compatibility documentation for common entrance, external candidates, certification and school ecosystem workflows.
## CBT v5 exam categories

CBT v5 expands the Exam Type dropdowns for school, admission, scholarship, recruitment, certification, STEM and standardised-practice workflows. Key exam types apply recommended settings automatically, but teachers can edit all settings before publishing.
## CBT v6 fullstack/SaaS repair

CBT v6 fixes the Supabase SQL pass-rate syntax error and adds SaaS-ready institution/audit-log database structures. The platform remains a static frontend with Supabase Auth/Postgres/RLS/RPC backend, making it a free-tier-friendly fullstack SaaS-style app. See `FULLSTACK_SAAS_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
## CBT v7 bug-fix package

CBT v7 fixes dark/black backgrounds when students save or print result/question reviews. It also adds a readable `Save Result + Questions` HTML export and strengthens Math/Science keyboard availability for pre-existing exams.
