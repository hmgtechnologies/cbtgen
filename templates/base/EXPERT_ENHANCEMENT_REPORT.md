## 2. Internet/market research summary

Modern CBT and online examination systems commonly include the following unique/high-value features:

| Market feature | Observed in market | Implemented/enhanced in HMG CBT |
|---|---|---|
| Question banks | Questionmark, Moodle, ProProfs, TestInvite | CSV/XLSX/manual import, exam packages, metadata columns. |
| Randomization | Questionmark, Moodle, JAMB practice apps | Random question selection and shuffled delivery. |
| Multiple question types | ProProfs, iSpring, Moodle, Eklavvya | 11+ types supported. |
| Secure browser/proctoring | Respondus, ExamSoft, Proctorio | Browser integrity flags and proctor snapshots using free tools. |
| Candidate verification | Proctoring platforms, enterprise CBT | Registered-student mode with secure RPC. |
| Scheduling | Enterprise exam tools | Start and close time support. |
| Attempt controls | LMS/CBT systems | Secure attempt-count RPC. |
| Analytics | ExamSoft, Questionmark, ProProfs | Result analytics, item analysis, CSV exports. |
| Certificates/credentials | ProProfs, SpeedExam | Submission/certificate verification code. |
| Offline/low-connectivity resilience | JAMB practice tools, offline CBT | PWA shell, drafts, emergency backup JSON. |
| Accessibility | Moodle/Inspera/modern exam tools | Read aloud, responsive UI, keyboard shortcuts. |
| Bulk import | Most CBT tools | CSV/XLSX/roster import. |
| Branding | Enterprise tools | HMG Academy/HMG Concepts embedded across files. |

Because the requirement was to use free-based tools and avoid AI API costs, paid features such as true lockdown browser, live remote proctors, SSO/LTI, and paid AI essay grading were not added. Instead, free browser/Supabase equivalents were implemented where realistic.

## 8. Final expert verdict

HMG Academy CBT Pro v3.1 is now a robust, free-tier, school-ready CBT system. The most important improvement is the corrected security posture: data access decisions are now handled in Supabase SQL/RLS/RPC instead of relying on frontend logic.

The platform is appropriate for:

- school quizzes;
- continuous assessment;
- terminal exams with supervision;
- WAEC/NECO/BECE/JAMB practice;
- tutorial centre mocks;
- low-cost institutional CBT pilots.

For high-stakes national/professional certification exams, pair it with human invigilation and additional operational controls.

## 2026-06-23 expert enhancement summary

Competitive platforms commonly advertise browser lockdown/proctoring, 15+ question types, exports, analytics, certificates, question banks, candidate management, and result audit trails. Comparable public feature references include ProProfs guidance on security controls, analytics and certificates; OnlineExamMaker's anti-cheating/candidate/certificate features; and ClassMarker's certificates, exports, access control, and proctoring.

Implemented without paid APIs:

1. Granular anti-cheat control per exam.
2. Optional proctoring instead of forced camera workflow.
3. Robust result-save RPC plus REST fallback to reduce “result not saved to dashboard” incidents.
4. Real verifiable certificate workflow backed by Supabase result records.
5. Expanded Math/Science on-screen keyboard with working symbol insertion.
6. Updated SQL, validator, and documentation.

Recommended post-deployment smoke test: create an exam with camera off, submit as a student, verify result appears on teacher dashboard, print/verify certificate, export CSV, delete one test result, then repeat with camera on.



## CBT v3 repository alignment

Updated teacher-facing question-type documentation, CSV template downloads, and `PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` to reflect the current 17 question types. The prompt template now provides ready-to-copy AI prompts for manual CSV generation while preserving the no-AI-API platform policy.
