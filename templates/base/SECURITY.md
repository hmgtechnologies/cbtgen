# Security Policy — HMG Academy CBT Pro v3.1

This document explains the security model, required configuration, operational precautions, and known limitations.

---

## 1. Security model

HMG Academy CBT Pro is a static frontend application backed by Supabase. Because HTML/JavaScript files are public by design, all critical access control must happen in Supabase through:

- Row Level Security (RLS)
- SQL helper functions
- RPC functions
- PostgreSQL-side admin checks
- strict use of anon key only in frontend

The v3.1 SQL setup implements this model in `COMPLETE_SQL_SETUP.sql`.

---

## 2. Keys and secrets

### Safe in frontend

- Supabase Project URL
- Supabase anon public key

### Never safe in frontend

- Supabase `service_role` key
- Database password
- SMTP credentials
- private API keys
- AI API keys
- payment secret keys

If a `service_role` key is ever exposed, rotate it immediately in Supabase.

---

## 3. RLS tables

| Table | Protection |
|---|---|
| `profiles` | Users see/update own profile; admins supervise all. |
| `exams` | Teachers manage own exams; admins supervise all. |
| `results` | Teachers see results for own exams; admins supervise all; students can insert only into open active exams. |
| `students` | Teachers manage own rosters; admins supervise all; anonymous lookup is blocked. |

---

## 4. Public student access

Students are not logged in. v3.1 therefore uses safe public RPCs instead of broad anonymous table reads.

| RPC | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `get_public_exam_by_code` | Loads only an open, non-archived, non-expired exam by code. Hides question data before scheduled start time. |
| `verify_student_for_exam` | Confirms a student ID belongs to the exam teacher’s roster without exposing the whole roster. |
| `get_exam_attempt_count` | Counts previous attempts for attempt-limit enforcement without exposing all results. |

---

## 5. Admin access

Admin RPC functions call `public.is_platform_admin()` inside PostgreSQL. A frontend-only admin check is never enough.

Admin access is granted when:

- the authenticated user has a profile row with `is_admin = true` or `role = 'admin'`; and
- `status = 'active'`;

or when the configured emergency admin email matches the JWT email.

Default embedded admin email in the repo:

```text
buildingmyictcareer@gmail.com
```

Change it in production if needed.

---

## 6. Exam-code safety

Exam codes are bearer-style access tokens. Anyone with the code/link can enter an open exam unless the exam is in registered mode.

Recommended controls:

- Use registered mode for high-stakes exams.
- Rotate codes if a link leaks.
- Set close time.
- Use start time for scheduled exams.
- Disable/close exams immediately after the session.
- Avoid posting high-stakes exam links in public groups.

---

## 7. Proctoring and integrity limits

Browser proctoring provides useful flags, not absolute proof of cheating.

### What it can detect/flag

- tab switching
- app/window focus loss
- right click
- copy/cut/paste attempts
- print/view-source/devtools shortcuts
- likely devtools window opening
- fullscreen exit
- camera snapshots if permitted
- multiple/no-face signal when optional model loads
- loud audio spikes

### What it cannot guarantee

- that the student has no second device
- perfect identity verification
- perfect face detection on all devices
- impossible-to-bypass browser controls
- high-stakes legal proctoring equivalence

For high-stakes exams, combine the platform with human invigilation, lab seating controls, ID checks, and post-exam result review.

---

## 8. Privacy guidance

The platform may store:

- student name/class/ID
- answers
- score
- timing
- integrity logs
- optional proctoring snapshots

Schools should:

- inform students before proctored exams;
- avoid unnecessary camera use for low-stakes quizzes;
- export and delete old data according to school policy;
- restrict admin access;
- protect CSV exports and backups.

---

## 9. Incident response

If something goes wrong:

1. Close affected exams in teacher/admin dashboard.
2. Rotate exam codes.
3. Export logs/results for audit.
4. Check Supabase SQL/RLS policies.
5. Check whether a frontend file accidentally contains a secret.
6. Rotate Supabase keys if secrets were exposed.
7. Re-run `COMPLETE_SQL_SETUP.sql`.
8. Re-test with a dummy exam.

---

## 10. Production hardening checklist

- [ ] HTTPS enabled.
- [ ] `COMPLETE_SQL_SETUP.sql` run fully.
- [ ] RLS enabled on all four tables.
- [ ] No broad anonymous `SELECT` policy on `students`.
- [ ] No broad anonymous `SELECT` policy on `results`.
- [ ] Student insert policy checks `is_exam_open_for_submission`.
- [ ] Admin RPC functions use `is_platform_admin`.
- [ ] No `service_role` key in frontend.
- [ ] Admin profile is active.
- [ ] Teacher approval workflow tested.
- [ ] Link checker tested.
- [ ] Deployment validator tested.
- [ ] Data export/backup policy defined.

- screenshots or console errors if available;
- whether real student data was involved.

## 2026-06-23 security notes

- Anonymous students should use RPC functions for public exam loading, attempt counting, certificate verification, and robust result submission. Do not create broad anonymous SELECT policies on `exams`, `students`, or `results`.
- Result saving has a security-definer RPC (`submit_student_result`) that checks `is_exam_open_for_submission()` before insert. This reduces RLS-related submission failures while avoiding table-wide reads.
- Camera and audio proctoring are optional per exam. They are evidence aids, not a replacement for school invigilation policy.
- Certificate verification uses stored result records; a printed certificate is not trusted unless the code verifies online.
## Admin-supervised teacher control mode

CBT v2 adds an admin control mode for teacher dashboards. The admin does not receive the teacher password and does not become the teacher in Supabase Auth. The admin uses their own admin token and selected teacher ID as the operating context. A visible ADMIN CONTROL MODE banner is shown. This feature requires secure admin RLS policies and should be limited to trusted school owners/super-admins.
## CBT v3 AI prompt safety

`PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` is for manual CSV question generation only. It must not introduce runtime AI APIs, paid API calls, service-role keys, or automatic external question generation inside the platform. Teachers may copy the prompt into any tool, review the output, and upload CSV manually.
## CBT v6 SaaS security additions

The SQL adds RLS-enabled `institutions` and `audit_logs` tables. Platform admins can manage institutions and audit logs; users can read their own audit entries. These structures prepare the platform for tenant-aware SaaS operation without exposing service-role keys.
